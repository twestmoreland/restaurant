					<h2>Jones&rsquo; Brisket Dilema</h2>
				</header>
				<p>The first pitmaster I ever worked with was a man named Rustik Jones. He could cook any rack of ribs to perfection, but his brisket and salmon, were a flop. I would work with him for several hours in a day teaching him how to make a brisket work, but it just wouldn&rsquo;t click. The Salmon he got better at within the first week, but the brisket, we were still working on by week four. Finally, in the last week of cooking, I looked at him and said, &ldquo;Rustik, I don&rsquo;t know what to do with you. Every other piece of your barbecue is good, you baste it right, use the right rubs, and even keep the right temperature the whole time. Why is it that you can&rsquo;t cook a good brisket?&rdquo; Rustik just shrugged and said, &ldquo;No idea.&rdquo; That week he closed his restaurant and devoted all his time to making briskets. I, of course, had to play judge and instructor. After chowing my way through enough meat to make a carnivore sick, Rustik pulled out the final brisket of our career together, and I knew; It was exactly what I had been trying to teach him how to do for the past two months.
				</p>
				<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you do it?&rdquo; I asked him.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I picked out my own damn meat,&rdquo; he said.</p>

				<h2>A Pain in the Daerier</h2>
			</header>
			<p>Beaver Drearier is the owner and pitmaster of The Pig&rsquo;s Drearier in downtown New Orleans. When I cam across his restaurant, I thought I had stepped into hog heaven. There were beautiful smells of smoked meats and spicy sausages coming from the kitchen. When I got my sausage and smoked ham though, I was not impressed. It was over spiced, the meat was tough, and the ham barely tasted as if it had been smoked at all. When I started working with Beaver, he showed no competency at all when handling the meats. We had to start from square one. By the end of week two, he could pick out the right meat for the job (I learned to teach this as step one after working with Rustik Jones). At week four, he could marinade, baste or rub down his meats to perfection. Week six, we were still working on not opening the grill before the meat was ready. After some thought, I decided to extend my time with him to help him out on this particular subject. Finally, by the time three months had rolled around, he was capable of making decent barbecue.</p>
			<p>I have visited since I first helped Beaver make decent barbecue and he has improved exponentially. I would recommend his restaurant to anyone I know. It&rsquo;s also fun to go just so you can say you&rsquo;ve been to The Pig&rsquo;s Drearier and watch the funny looks you&rsquo;ll get.</p>

				<h2>Simeon&rsquo;s Change of Pace</h2>
			</header>
			<p>Simeon Jet is a pitmaster from South Carolina bringing his best to New Orleans. He is the owner of Hog Heaven. The little restaurant lies on the outskirts of town and boasts heaps of different kinds of wood for all kinds of smoking. When I came across him, he could cook the best darn meat you ever put in your mouth, but never, ever, ever, I mean never, could you eat any rubs or sauces he put on his meats. Almost all of them tasted like a chemical experiment gone wrong. The worst part was that when I pointed this out to him, he said that&rsquo;s how it was supposed to taste and he challenged me to a cook-off. I hemmed and hawed and told him it wouldn&rsquo;t be fair, but, in the end, I graciously accepted. The next week, we had a barbecue show down in which several of Simeon&rsquo;s family members came to help and many of my previous students came to judge. The meat was laid in front of the judges and not thirty minutes later, Simeon&rsquo;s sauces and rubs were deemed disgusting. He stopped off in a huff. A few weeks later, though, I got a call. Simeon&rsquo;s business was running into the ground and he needed the help, bad. Everyone was referring him to me, so he sucked up his pride and called. I will forever respect him for doing such a thing. I started teaching him not twenty four hours after that and barely even a week later, he had the best friggin&rsquo; barbecue I&rsquo;ve ever tasted laid down on the tables for all to admire, and eat.</p>
