			<h1>Barbecue Review</h1>
			<section>
				<p>I&lsquo;ve been to most of the restaurants here New Orleans, including all of the ones that serve any form of barbecue. I also write reviews on these restaurants and you&lsquo;ll find those below.</p>

			<header>
				<h2>Blue Oak Barbecue</h2>
				<p>Inside Chickie Wah Wah, 2828 Canal St., New Orleans, 504.822.2583</p>
			</header>
			<p>New Orleans has a rich recent history of serious barbecue flowering inside (or very near) established drinking establishments. Blue Oak, which occupies the small kitchen inside Chickie Wah Wah music club, is at this moment the best of the species. It is particularly adept at marrying the barbecue and bar snack traditions. So go ahead: Order the nachos.</p>

				<p>Best &lsquo;cue: Beef brisket, smoked housemade sausage, smoked chicken wings.</p>
				<p>Best sides: Roasted Brussels sprouts, ginger-sesame slaw.</p>

			<header>
				<h2>Hillbilly Bar-B-Q</h2>
				<p>2317 Hickory Ave., Harahan, 504.738.1508</p>
			</header>
			<p>Hillbilly was born as a take-out joint inside a cinderblock structure tucked behind a River Ridge bar. In 2011, Kentucky-native Larry Wyatt moved his operation into a markedly more commodious space attached to the Kamp bar in Harahan. His barbecue is as good as ever.</p>

				<p>Best &lsquo;cue: Beef brisket, chicken, pull pork sandwich</p>
				<p>Best sides: Corn salad, cole slaw</p>

			<header>
				<h2>The Joint</h2>
				<p>701 Mazant St., New Orleans, 504.949.3232</p>
			</header>
			<p>In 2004, Pete and Jenny Breen opened the Joint on Poland Avenue, where it grew into an increasingly inviting if cramped outpost for barbecue. Since moving to Mazant Street in 2012, The Joint has become the best all-around barbecue restaurant in New Orleans. You still have to order at the cash register, but there is table service after that, and the menu, which is solid from top-to-bottom, is now abetted by a full bar. Keep your eyes open for the smoked pastrami, a mid-week special that sells out quickly.</p>

				<h2>LA 23 BBQ</h2>
				<p>9661 Louisiana 23, Belle Chasse, 504.657.3693</p>
			</header>
			<p>LA 23 BBQ backs up to the railroad tracks and levee across the highway from the entrance to the Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base in Belle Chasse, accounting for the high percentage of customers who arrive in uniform. You might mistake the place for a snowball stand &mdash; it&lsquo;s that small &mdash; if not for the smoker positioned in front and the chopped hardwood stacked against a nearby shed. Bobby Monsted lll and Aaron Gelfand opened the place after passing the location innumerable times on their way to work as fishing guides in Venice. The Texas-style barbecue is served during lunch only for as long as supplies last, so go early. It would be depressing to miss out on anything LA 23 has to offer. The partners plan to open a bigger restaurant in the same spot in late 2015, early 2016. </p>

			<header>
				<h2>McClure's Barbecue</h2>
				<p>4800 Magazine St., New Orleans, 504.301.2367</p>
			</header>
			<p>By the narrow standards of the barbecue joint form, McClure's covers a lot of ground. It features sauces from all corners of the Barbecue Nation (including Nola East!), tacos, a country take on chicken Cordon Bleu and one of the best cheeseburgers in New Orleans. The smoked meat is still the primary reason to visit. And by the time you read this, you will likely be able to get it at a second location inside the new Nola Brewing Tap Room.</p>

			<header>
				<h2>NOLA Smokehouse</h2>
				<p>739 Jackson Ave., New Orleans, 504.418.2591</p>
			</header>
			<p>Rob Bechtold, a former executive sous chef at K-Paul&lsquo;s, brings a chefly obsession for detail to his bare-bones barbecue place in the Irish Channel. The thin layers of char encasing the sinewy, free-range and natural meats &mdash; the pork ribs and brisket as well as the pork butts he pulls apart for sandwiches and platters &mdash; contain worlds of flavor themselves, and the relatively small selection of sides are well crafted. Smoked prime rib nights are set to resume in the fall.</p>

				<p>Best &lsquo;cue: Burnt ends, pulled pork, smoked sausage</p>
				<p>Best sides: Sweet corn spoonbread, barbecue beans</p>

			<header>
				<h2>Papa&lsquo;s Backyard Bar-B-Q</h2>
				<p>2848 Slidell Ave., Slidell, 985.288.5011</p>
			</header>
			<p>Ronald Robinson&lsquo;s Slidell barbecue restaurant doubles as a memorial to his son Ronald Jr., who died in 2010. The meat, cooked crisp and fragrant in an indoor, wood-fired smoker, is a fine and poignant tribute. And the meat isn&lsquo;t the only reason to seek out this unassuming, strip mall restaurant off the main drag. The chunky bread pudding, made from sandwich buns, stuffed with chocolate chips and served under a warm rum sauce, should land on your list of favorites.</p>
			<footer>
				<p>Best &lsquo;cue: Ribs, pulled pork sandwich, smoked chicken wings</p>
				<p>Best sides/desserts: Red beans and rice, candied yams, bread pudding</p>

				<h2>Walker&lsquo;s Southern Style BBQ</h2>
				<p>10828 Hayne Blvd., New Orleans, 504.241.8227</p>
			</header>
			<p>Walker&lsquo;s is home of the cochon de lait po-boy sold at Jazz Fest, which is to say the sandwich that essentially put what might be called &ldquo;Louisiana-style barbecue&rdquo; on the map in New Orleans. That great sandwich is essentially pulled pork by another name, and the rest of the smoked meat at this lunch-only barbecue restaurant lives up to its high standard.</p>
			<footer>
				<p>Best &lsquo;cue: Beef brisket, pork ribs, cochon de lait po-boy</p>
				<p>Best sides: Baked beans, mustard greens</p>
