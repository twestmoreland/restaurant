				<h1>Brisket Bob&rsquo;s New Orleans Barbecue</h1>
			</div>
			<section class="column push-4 append-4">
				<p>Barbecue in New Orleans has always been a work in progress. The same could be said of the restaurants that have carried our local barbecue scene firmly into the realm of respectability.
				Ten years ago, New Orleans wasn&rsquo;t exactly a barbecue backwater, but it boasted just a handful of solid options for this great southern culinary expression. When it comes to food, particularly southern food, New Orleans is used to ranking higher than that.</p>
				<div class="column twenty">
					<p>Thing is, New Orleans doesn&rsquo;t reside in what you would call Barbecue Country. We don&rsquo;t have the deep traditions for smoked meat that fuels tourism in Texas, Tennessee and the Carolinas. We have different culinary traditions, much of them having to do with cooking things that used to swim.</p>
					<p >Today, however, New Orleans does have some really good barbecue, more so than ever before, and much of the credit for that goes to serious barbecue craftsmen who have grown in both stature and skill before our very eyes. The kinks, however, do still need to be worked out and it is my job to do just that. My job is to go to barbeque restaurants in New Orleans and make good barbeque pitmasters better.</p>

					<p>Simeon Jet is a pitmaster from South Carolina bringing his best to New Orleans. He is the owner of Hog Heaven. The little restaurant lies on the outskirts of town and boasts heaps of different kinds of wood for all kinds of smoking. When I came across him, he could cook the best darn meat you ever put in your mouth, but never, ever, ever, I mean never, eat any rubs or sauces he put on his meats. Almost all of them tasted like a chemical experiment gone wrong...<a href="reviews.html#simeon" class="floatright">Read More</a></p>

				<h2>Best Gadget: Instant-Probe Thermometer</h2>

				<p class="column push-4 append-4">Although there are less precise ways of determining the doneness of steak or pork chops, for best accuracy you&rsquo;ll want a thermometer. When asked, both of our experts agreed that the only real way to tell if your meat is cooked is by checking the internal temperature with an instant-read thermometer. Based on dozen of hours of research and testing for our guide to instant-read thermometers&mdash;as well as the input of our grilling experts&mdash;we highly recommend the $30 ThermoWorks ThermoPop Digital Thermometer... <a href="recipes/gadgets.html#thermometer" class="floatright">Read More</a></p>
