			<h1>My Job</h1>
			<section>
				<p>If you don&rsquo;t already know, my job is to go to barbeque restaurants and make good barbeque pitmasters better in six weeks. I travel all over New Orleans looking for the people who need my help the most. In some cases, the pitmasters really do their best work and turn out some barbecue that&rsquo;s ten times better than what it was. Other times, they just don&rsquo;t get anywhere. The students that turn out the best of the best, though, are given the title of awarded pitmaster. Here is where you get to hear those stories, as well as hear about which restaurants are the best to go to get your barbecue fix, what tools are best for getting that barbecue cooked, and just some great tips for making any good pitmaster, better.</p>

						<h3>A Pain in the Drearier</h3>
					</header>
					<section>
						<p>Beaver Drearier is the owner and pitmaster of The Pig&rsquo;s Drearier in downtown New Orleans. When I cam across his restaurant, I thought I had stepped into hog heaven. There were beautiful smells of smoked meats and spicy sausages coming from the kitchen. When I got my sausage and smoked ham though, I was not impressed. It was over spiced, the meat was tough, and the ham barely tasted as if it had been smoked at all...</p>

						<h3>Jone&rsquo;s Brisket Dilema</h3>
					</header>
					<section>
						<p>The first pitmaster I ever worked with was a man named Rustik Jones. He could cook any rack of ribs to perfection, but his brisket and salmon were a flop. I would work with him for several hours in a day teaching him how to make a brisket work, but it just wouldn&rsquo;t click. The Salmon he got better at within the first week, but the brisket, we were still working on by week four...</p>

					<h3>Blue Oak BBQ</h3>
					<p>5 out of 5</p>
					<p>Blue Oak is a restaurant adept at marrying the barbecue with bar snack traditions.</p>

					<h3>Hillbilly Bar-B-Q</h3>
					<p>5 out of 5</p>
					<p>Hillbilly was born as a take-out joint inside a cinderblock structure tucked behind a River Ridge bar. Larry Wyatt's barbecue is as good as ever.</p>

				<a href="restaurant-reviews.html#TheJoint">
					<h3>The Joint</h3>
					<p>4.5 out of 5</p>
					<p>The Joint has become the best all-around barbecue restaurant in New Orleans. Keep your eyes open for the smoked pastrami, a mid-week special that sells out quickly.</p>

				<a href="restaurant-reviews.html#La23BBQ">
					<h3>LA 23 BBQ</h3>
					<p>4.5 out of 5</p>
					<p>You might mistake the place for a snowball stand – it's that small – if not for the smoker positioned in front and the chopped hardwood stacked against a nearby shed. The Texas-style barbecue is served during lunch only for as long as supplies last, so go early. </p>

				<a href="restaurant-reviews.html#McClureBBQ">
					<h3>McClure's Barbecue</h3>
					<p>4.5 out of 5</p>
					<p>By the narrow standards of the barbecue joint form, McClure's covers a lot of ground. It features sauces from all corners of the Barbecue Nation (including Nola East!), tacos, a country take on chicken Cordon Bleu and one of the best cheeseburgers in New Orleans.</p>

				<a href="restaurant-reviews.html#NOLA">
					<h3>NOLA Smokehouse</h3>
					<p>4 out of 5</p>
					<p>The thin layers of char encasing the sinewy, free-range and natural meats – the pork ribs and brisket as well as the pork butts he pulls apart for sandwiches and platters -- contain worlds of flavor themselves, and the relatively small selection of sides are well crafted.</p>

				<a href="restaurant-reviews.html#PapaBBQ">
					<h3>Papa's Backyard Bar-B-Q</h3>
					<p>4 out of 5</p>
					<p>The meat, cooked crisp and fragrant in an indoor, wood-fired smoker, is a fine and poignant tribute to the owner's long lost son.</p>

				<a href="restaurant-reviews.html#WalkerSouthern">
					<h3>Walker's Southern Style BBQ</h3>
					<p>4 out of 5</p>
					<p>The po-boy great sandwich is essentially pulled pork by another name, and the rest of the smoked meat at this lunch-only barbecue restaurant lives up to its high standard.</p>
